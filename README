# Mox

Mox is a Drupal theme for Drupal 7.x. It can either be used as a basetheme, or you can just pick up the stuff you need and build your own. It's the starting point I use for most of my Drupal themes.

The goal is to create a theme, that gets rid of all the unpleasantries, and adds just the stuff you need. Nothing more.

You won't find a plethora of different theme-settings, only a few very basic things like debugging. The goal is to keep everything that is related to presentation located where it belongs: In the code.

- Beware, that this is a work in progress, but the theme is usable as it is.

This theme contains code and scraps picked up over a few years. Most prominent is the [Tao base theme](http://drupal.org/projects/tao).

## Mox features as of 2012-06-21:

* Semantic grid system (largely an implementation of [semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs)).
* HTML5.
* Clean, optimized code that makes sense.

## Roadmap:

The next to-do implementing a complete and basic design of the following elements:

* Layout
* Typography
* Forms
* Tables
* Lists
