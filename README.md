# Mox

Mox is a Drupal theme for Drupal 7.x. It can either be used as a basetheme, or you can just pick out the stuff you need and build your own. It's the starting point I use for most of my Drupal themes.

The goal is to create a theme, that gets rid of all the unpleasantries, and adds just the stuff you need. Nothing more. It should be easy to extend the design and functionality.

You won't find a plethora of different theme-settings, only a few very basic things like debugging. The goal is to keep everything related to presentation located where it belongs: In code.

- Beware! This version is in alpha, but the theme should be usable as it is. Feel free to check it out.

This theme builds on code and scraps picked up over a few years. Standing on shoulders of giants.

## Mox features as of 2012-06-21:

* Semantic grid system (largely an implementation of [semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs)).
* HTML5 through and through.
* Clean, optimized code that makes sense.
* Panels support.

## Roadmap:

The next to-do is implementing a complete and basic design of the following elements:

* Layout
* Basic navigation
* Typography
* Forms
* Tables
* Lists
